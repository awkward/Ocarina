# Ocarina

A library to receive metadata and Open Graph information from URLs.

### Introduction

Hi, we're <a href="https://awkward.co/" target="_blank">Awkward</a>. We were looking for a way to visualize information behind links to present these in our iOS reddit client called <a href="https://beamreddit.com/" target="_blank">Beam</a>. We initially used a server to receive metadata, but the server became quite crowded with calls. We built Ocarina as a solution to that problem. Fallbacks for basic HTML tags and Twitter card information make this metadata fetcher unique. We welcome you to use Ocarina for your own projects. 

### Features

- Fetching of basic metadata for individual links using the OGP protocol or basic HTML tags (twitter card information also available)
- Memory cache of metadata for each link
- Prefetching a set of links to make views more responsive
- Link information can include: type, title, description, image, image size, favicon, and Apple touch icon
